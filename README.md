## **Mental Health Sentiment Analysis Using NLP & Machine Learning**

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to perform sentiment analysis on mental health-related content. The goal is to classify posts and comments from online forums, blogs, and social media into different **mental health states** such as **Normal**, **Anxiety**, **Bipolar**, **Depression**, and **Suicidal Messages**.

### **Models Evaluated**:

* **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
* **Decision Tree**
* **Logistic Regression**
* **XGBoost (XGB)**

Among the models, **XGBoost** emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of **81%** and superior classification of different mental health states. The model demonstrated high F1 scores, particularly in **Normal (93%)**, **Anxiety**, and **Bipolar** (85%). The confusion matrix and word cloud analysis revealed some overlap between **depression** and **suicidal messages**, but XGBoost still provided the most accurate classification.

### **Key Features**:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Includes **tokenization**, **lemmatization**, and **TF-IDF** feature extraction.
* **Model Training**: Utilized **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and **RandomOverSampler** for handling class imbalance.
* **Visualization**: Generates **WordClouds** and **Confusion Matrices** to analyze model performance.
* **Evaluation**: Includes **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** metrics for each classifier.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python**(for machine learning and data processing)
* **Google Colab** (for model training with A100 GPU)
  Scikit-learn, XGBoost, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib
